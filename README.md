Docker Course Contents for my students

## What is Docker?

It is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers which helps developers,system admins to develop, deploy and run applications.

## Docker Image File

A Docker image is a file containing everything needed to run an application as a container. This includes:

* Code
* Libraries
* Environment variables
* Configuration files

The docker image file can then be deployed to any Docker environment and executable as a container.
